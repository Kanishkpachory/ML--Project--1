Overview
The primary goal of this project is to provide a reliable and data-driven method for predicting house prices in Bangalore city. The model takes into account a range of features including property size, location, amenities, and other relevant factors to make predictions about house rates.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about properties in Bangalore, including features like size, location, number of bedrooms, and more. You can find the dataset in the data directory. It's provided as a CSV file, and you can explore it to understand the data's structure and attributes used for predictions.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

data/: Contains the dataset file (bangalore_property_data.csv).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, data preprocessing, and model development.
src/: Source code for the machine learning models and data preprocessing.
requirements.txt: Lists the Python packages required for the project.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed. The list of necessary packages is provided in the requirements.txt file.
